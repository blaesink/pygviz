# A speednet is a faster way to link everything together
# than typing out everything.

# Example Data:
# {
#     "data": ["Tom", "Jerry", "Mike", "Jim"],
#     "rels": [(0,1,3), (2,0,1), (3,2,1)]
# }
# The first index in the tuple is the *root*.
# The *root* will connect to everything after it, creating the expected linkage
# 0 -- 1
# 0 -- 3
#
# The Goal is to set everything ONCE, then build off of the indices.
# A speednet should much faster in theory for small to
# medium-ish sized structures, where you can keep track of the indices and
# write through it quickly.
